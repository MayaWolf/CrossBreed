* The BNC can run on any desktop platform using native .NET or Mono. There currently is no download, you'll have to build it yourself.

## What do I need to use it?
* For Windows: At least .NET 4.6. It's likely already on your PC, but if not, you can get it [here](https://www.microsoft.com/de-at/download/details.aspx?id=48137).
* For Android: At least Android 4.0.3 (API 15).
* To use the BNC on a non-Windows platform, you'll need Mono to run it.
